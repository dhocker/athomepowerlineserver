# Version 0.4.x.x of meross-iot appears to be incompatible with 0.3.4.6 - it uses asyncio
# This code uses asyncio and expects version 0.4.0.0+
#
# As a side note, it is not clear what was gained by rewriting the code to
# use asyncio. The level of complication that was introduced exceeds most of the
# gain you might get. Figuring out the request throttling scheme is a considerable
# exercise.
