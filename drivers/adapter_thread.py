#
# The Meross-iot module makes significant use of asyncio. asyncio has a
# number of limitations that make it somewhat difficult to deal with in
# a multi-threaded application.
# The asyncio documentation itself explicitly states that it is not
# inherently thread safe. It appears to have been designed to run
# on the main thread.
#
# The athomeserver uses multiple threads.
# For example, each network connection (read incoming command) arrives on its
# own thread. The timer program thread checks and triggers timer programs.
# Device drivers are initialized on the main thread.
#
# This means that all Meross-iot code must be isolated to a single thread.
# Otherwise, asyncio will throw thread related exceptions when least expected.
#
# This adapter is inherently thread safe. The request queue (a Queue) is used as the
# synchronization method. A Queue is thread safe (see Queue.put and Queue.get).
# The adapter takes/gets one request at a time from the request queue making it
# thread safe.
