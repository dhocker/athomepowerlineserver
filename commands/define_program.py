        # The CM11A X10 controller expects time in terms of the number of minutes
        # since midnight of the current day. Here, we play with converting
        # the on/off times to that format.
        # Note: In this implementation there is not real reason to limit timers
        # to the HH:MM format. We are never going to store these in an X10 controller.
        # In this implementation the server IS the X10 controller. The hardware X10 controller
        # is just a down-stream component used to transmit immediate X10 signals.
